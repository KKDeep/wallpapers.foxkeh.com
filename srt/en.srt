Hello! My name is Foxkeh.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
“Foxkeh’s Wallpaper Creator” is a tool

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
that allows you to easily create your own

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
wallpaper on browser using my images.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Since it makes use of an advanced web-

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
based technology called SVG, 

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
it allows for the personalization of

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
various designs just by using Firefox

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
without installing any plug-ins.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You can select the graphic and move it around, 

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
change its size, 

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
make it transparent 

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and even change the design

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
into a character you like.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The finished design can be made

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
into a wallpaper on your PC, 

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
set as the standby wallpaper

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
on your mobile phone

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
or used as a Personas theme that allows you

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
to change the look of the Firefox web browser.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Let’s get creative and make

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
your own wallpaper on Firefox!
